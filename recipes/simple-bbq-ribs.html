                    <p>You'll find the full, simple recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making these BBQ ribs: </p>
                    <h2 class="boiltheribs">Boil the Ribs</h2>
                    <p>Bring ribs, spices, and water to a boil and cook until ribs are tender.</p>
                    <h2>Coat the Ribs With Barbecue Sauce</h2>
                    <p>Place the boiled ribs in a baking dish and cover with your favorite barbecue sauce (either store-bought or homemade).</p>
                    <h2 class="bake">Bake</h2>
                    <p>Bake the ribs, covered, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.</p>
                    <h2>When To Put Barbecue Sauce on Ribs</h2>
                    <p>We like the method this recipe uses, which is to put the barbecue sauce on the ribs after they're boiled — but before they go in the oven. This will allow the ribs to get all the barbecue flavor while the sauce bakes into the ribs.</p>
                    <p>If you want, you can serve these BBQ ribs with an extra side of barbecue sauce for dipping.</p>
